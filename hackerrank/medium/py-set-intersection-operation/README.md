__.intersection()__<br>  

The *.intersection()* operator returns the intersection of a set and the set of elements in an iterable.<br>
Sometimes, the *&* operator is used in place of the *.intersection()* operator, but it only operates on the set of elements in _set_.<br>
The set is immutable to the *.intersection()* operation (or *&* operation).

    >>> s = set("Hacker")
    >>> print s.intersection("Rank")
    set(['a', 'k'])

    >>> print s.intersection(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
    set(['a', 'k'])

    >>> print s.intersection(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
    set(['a', 'k'])

    >>> print s.intersection(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
    set([])

    >>> print s.intersection({"Rank":1})
    set([])

    >>> s & set("Rank")
    set(['a', 'k'])
